# Wave Application Configuration

Set Wave configuration values using environment variables or in [`config.yml`](./config.yml) configuration file

### config.yml configuration

Declare YAML configuration values in [`config.yml`](./config.yml)
```
wave:
    mail:
        from: "wave-app@seqera.io"
```

YAML configuration keys on this page are listed in "dot" notation, i.e., the mail from value in the snippet above is represented as `wave.mail.from` in the tables that follow.
Environment variables for various attributes has been listed in third column, either you can provide those attributes values in config.yml or using corresponding environment variable.
