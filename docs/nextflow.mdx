title: Nextflow integration
---

You can use Wave directly from your Nextflow pipelines, with full support for private repositories, container freezing, and conda packages.

This feature requires Nextflow `22.10.0` or later.

You can use Wave can in any Nextflow pipeline by adding the following snippet to your `nextflow.config` file:

```groovy
wave {
    enabled = true
}

tower {
    accessToken = '<your_access_token>'
}
```

The use of the Seqera access token is not mandatory. However, it grants the following additional capabilities:

- Access to private repositories
- More API requests than is permitted for anonymous users

For the entire list of configuration options, see [Configuration options](#configuration-options).

## Use Wave with Nextflow

The following sections describe several common usage cases. To get started by creating an example pipeline that uses Wave, see [Get started][start].

[start]: ./get-started.mdx#nextflow

### Access private container repositories

Wave allows the use of private repositories in your Nextflow pipelines. The repository access keys must be provided in the form of [Seqera Platform credentials][credentials].

<details open>
<summary>**Access private container repositories**</summary>

After creating the credentials, specify your [personal access token][pat] in your pipeline configuration file. If the credentials were created in a Seqera Platform organization workspace, specify the workspace ID as well in the config file as shown below:

```groovy
tower {
  accessToken = '<your access token>'
  workspaceId = '<your workspace id>'
}
```

Containers built by Wave are uploaded to the Wave default repository hosted on AWS ECR with name `195996028523.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wave/build`. The images in this repository are automatically deleted 1 week from the date of their push.

If you want to store Wave containers in your own container repository use the following settings in the Nextflow configuration file:

```groovy
wave.build.repository = 'example.com/your/build-repo'
wave.build.cacheRepository = 'example.com/your/cache-repo'
```

The first repository is used to store the built container images. The second one is used to store the individual image layers for caching purposes.

When launching the pipeline execution, Wave allows Nextflow to access the private container repositories defined in your pipeline configuration, by using the credentials stored in the Seqera Platform credentials manager.

### Build Nextflow modules containers

Wave can build and provision container images on-demand for your Nextflow pipelines.

<details open>
<summary>**Build Nextflow modules containers**</summary>

To enable this feature, add the Dockerfile of the container to be built in the [module directory][module-directory] where the pipeline process is defined. When Wave is enabled, it automatically uses the Dockerfile to build the required container, upload to the registry, and it uses the container to execute the script defined in the process.

Make sure the process does not declare a `container` directive, otherwise it will take precedence over the Dockerfile definition.

If a process uses a `container` directive and you still want to build the container using the Dockerfile provided in the module directory, add the following setting to the pipeline config file:

```groovy
wave.strategy = ['dockerfile','container']
```

This setting instructs Wave to prioritize the module Dockerfile over process `container` directives.

:::warning
When building containers, Wave currently does not support `ADD`, `COPY`, or any other Dockerfile commands that access files in the host file system.
:::

</details>

### Build Conda-based containers

Wave allows the provisioning of containers based on the `process-conda` [directive][process-conda] used by the processes in your pipeline. This is a quick alternative to building Conda packages in the local computer. Moreover, this enables the use of Conda packages in your pipeline when deploying in cloud-native platforms such as AWS Batch and Kubernetes, which do not allow the convenient use of the Conda package manager.

<details open>
<summary>**Build Conda-based containers**</summary>

With Wave enabled in your pipeline, simply define the `conda` requirements in the pipeline processes, provided the same process does not also specify a `container` directive or a Dockerfile.

In the latter case, add the following setting to your pipeline configuration:

```groovy
wave.strategy = ['conda']
```

The above setting instructs Wave to use the `conda` directive to provision the pipeline containers and ignore the `container` directive and any Dockerfile(s).

For versions of Nextflow 23.10.x or newer, when a container is provisioned, the `conda-forge::procps-ng` package is included automatically. This package includes the `ps` command.

Some configuration options in the `conda` scope are used when Wave is used to build Conda-based containers.
For example, the Conda channels and their priority can be set with `conda.channels`:

```groovy
wave.strategy = ['conda']
conda.channels = 'seqera,conda-forge,bioconda,defaults'
```

### Build Singularity containers

Nextflow can build Singularity native images on-demand using `Singularityfile`,
Conda packages. The Singularity images are automatically uploaded in a container registry OCI compliant
of your choice and stored as a [ORAS artifact](https://oras.land/).

:::note
Available as of Nextflow version 23.09.0-edge.
:::

<details open>
<summary>**Build Singularity containers**</summary>

:::note
This feature requires a version of Singularity (or Apptainer) that supports pulling images using the `oras:` pseudo-protocol.
:::

For example to enable the provisioning of Singularity images in your pipeline use the following configuration snippet:

```groovy
singularity.enabled = true
wave.enabled = true
wave.freeze = true
wave.strategy = ['conda']
wave.build.repository = 'docker.io/user/repo'
```

In the above configuration replace `docker.io/user/repo` with a repository of your choice where Singularity image files
should be uploaded.

When using a private repository, the repository access keys must be provided via the Seqera Platform credentials manager. For more information, see [Authenticate private repositories][private].

Moreover the access to the repository must be granted in the compute nodes by using the command `singularity remote login <registry>`.
Please see Singularity documentation for further details.

In order to build Singularity native images, both `singularity.ociAutoPull` and `singularity.ociMode` must be disabled in the configuration. For more information, see the Nextflow [configuration][config] documentation.

### Use Wave with Fusion

Wave containers allows you to run your containerized workflow with the Fusion file system.

<details open>
<summary>**Use Wave with Fusion**</summary>

This enables the use of an object storage bucket such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage as your pipeline work directory, simplifying and speeding up many operations on local, AWS Batch, Google Batch or Kubernetes executions.

For more information, refer to the following documentation pages:

- [Fusion documentation][fusion]
- [Nextflow Fusion integration documentation][nextflow-fusion]

| `wave.build.cacheRepository` | The container repository used to cache image layers build by the Wave service (note: the corresponding credentials need to be provided in your Seqera Platform account). |
| `wave.conda.mambaImage`      | The Mamba container image is used to build Conda based container. This is expected to be [micromamba-docker](https://github.com/mamba-org/micromamba-docker) image.      |
| `wave.conda.commands`        | One or more commands to be added to the Dockerfile used by build a Conda based image.                                                                                    |
| `wave.strategy`              | The strategy to be used when resolving ambiguous Wave container requirement (default: `'container,dockerfile,conda'`)                                                    |
| `wave.freeze`                | When `freeze` mode is enabled containers provisioned by Wave are stored permanently in the repository specified via the setting `wave.build.repository`.                 |

## Limitations

### Use of sha256 digest in the image name

The Wave does not support the use of sha256 digest in the image name, e.g. `ubuntu@sha256:3235...ce8f`, when using
the augmentation process to extend container images.

In order to reference a container via sha256 digest in the image name with Wave you will need to *freeze* image mode
that will force the creation of a new container image using the container you have specified as base image.

In your pipeline configuration, ensure that you specify the following settings:

```groovy
wave.enabled = true
wave.freeze = true
wave.strategy = ['dockerfile']
wave.build.repository = 'docker.io/<user>/<repository>'
```
