## Wave Usage Metrics

Wave uses Redis to store its usage metrics for a specific date and/or a specific organisation.

These are stored using the following keys:

1. pulls/d/YYYY-MM-DD
2. pulls/o/<org>
3. pulls/o/<org>/d/YYYY-MM-DD
4. fusion/d/YYYY-MM-DD
5. fusion/o/<org>
6. fusion/o/<org>/d/YYYY-MM-DD
7. builds/d/YYYY-MM-DD
8. builds/o/<org>
9. builds/o/<org>/d/YYYY-MM-DD

### Functionality

#### Store Builds

When wave launches a build, it also increments values of the following keys in Redis

1. builds/d/YYYY-MM-DD
2. builds/o/<org>
3. builds/o/<org>/d/YYYY-MM-DD

#### Store Pulls

Wave tracks the container image pulls using io.seqera.wave.filter.PullMetricsRequestsFilter, where it checks if content-type header contains one of the following values:

1. application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json
2. application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json
3. application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v1+prettyjws
4. application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v1+json

Then it increments values of the following keys in Redis:

1. pulls/d/YYYY-MM-DD
2. pulls/o/<org>
3. pulls/o/<org>/d/YYYY-MM-DD

Then it checks, if the pulled container has fusion, if its does then it increments values of the following keys in Redis:

1. fusion/d/YYYY-MM-DD
2. fusion/o/<org>
3. fusion/o/<org>/d/YYYY-MM-DD

### How keys are created

1. When every a request is made to wave, first it increments the key with date. for example `builds/d/2024-04-23`.
2. Keys with organization are only incremented if the user is authenticated means there is tower token in the request.
3. Wave extract the domain from the email id (For example: `test_metrics@seqera.io`) of the user, which it gets from tower using the access token.
4. The organization value will be `seqera.io`
5. Then it increments the key with organization. For example: `builds/o/seqera.io/d/2024-04-23` and `builds/o/seqera.io`
