title: Build a container and freeze to a container registry
---

The Wave CLI supports building a container and persisting the container to a container registry, such as DockerHub. You can refer to this frozen container image in a Dockerfile or [Nextflow] pipeline in the same way as any other container.

To freeze a container, you must ensure the following conditions are met:

- You created a Seqera Platform access token.
- You specified the destination container registry credentials in Seqera Platform.
- You specify the Seqera Platform access token via either the `TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable or the `--tower-token` Wave command line option.

## Related CLI arguments

The following arguments are used to freeze a container build:

- `--build-repo`: A target repository to save the built container to.
- `--freeze`: Enable a container freeze.
- `--tower-token`: A Seqera Platform auth token so that Wave can access your private registry credentials. Not required if the `TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is set.
- `--tower-workspace-id`: A Seqera Platform workspace ID, such as `1234567890`, where credentials may be stored.

## Example usage

In the following example, the `alpine` container image is frozen to a private DockerHub image registry. The `--tower-token` argument is not required if the `TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is defined.

```
wave -i alpine --freeze \
  --build-repo docker.io/user/repo --tower-token <TOKEN>
```
