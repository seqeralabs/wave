To install the `wave` CLI for your platform, complete the following steps:

1.  Download the [latest version of the Wave CLI][download] for your platform.

2.  In a new terminal, complete the following steps:

    1. Move the executable from your downloads folder to a location in your `PATH`, such as `~/bin`. For example: `mv wave-cli-0.8.0-macos-x86_64 ~/bin/wave`
    2. Ensure that the executable bit is set. For example: `chmod u+x ~/bin/wave`

3. You can also use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) in macos and linux, you can install like this:
   ```bash
   brew install seqeralabs/tap/wave-cli
   ```

4.  Verify that you can build containers with Wave:

    1.  Create a basic `Dockerfile`:

        ```
        cat << EOF > ./Dockerfile
        FROM busybox:latest
        EOF
        ```

    2.  Use the CLI to build the container:

        ```
        wave -f Dockerfile
        ```

        Example output:
