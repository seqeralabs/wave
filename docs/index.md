# Wave container provisioning service

_Rethink containers for cloud-native data pipelines_

Containers are an essential part of data analysis in the cloud. Building and delivering optimized, context-aware
container images slows down development.

Wave is a container provisioning service designed for use with data analysis applications such as Nextflow.

It allows for the on-demand assembly, augmentation, and deployment of containerized images based on task requirements.
