## Mandatory steps

Wave 1.21.0 introduces support for PostgreSQL as the primary database backend, replacing SurrealDB.

To upgrade your existing data from SurrealDB to PostgreSQL:

1. Follow the steps in the [Wave database migration from SurrealDB to PostgreSQL](../db-migration.md) guide.
2. Add the following properties to your Wave configuration file:

    - `wave.build.logs.path`: Sets the path inside  `wave.build.logs.bucket`, where build logs will be stored.
    - `wave.build.locks.path`: Sets the path inside `wave.build.logs.bucket`, where conda lock files will be stored.
