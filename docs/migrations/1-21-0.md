Wave 1.21.0 was released on May 29, 2025.

## Mandatory steps

Wave 1.21.0 introduces support for PostgreSQL as the primary database backend, replacing SurrealDB.

To upgrade your existing data from SurrealDB to PostgreSQL:

1. Follow the steps in the [Wave database migration](../db-migration.md) guide.
2. Add the following properties to your Wave configuration file:

    - `wave.build.logs.path`: Sets the full path where build logs will be stored (e.g., `s3://my-bucket/wave/logs` or a local path).
    - `wave.build.locks.path`: Sets the full path where Conda lock files will be stored (e.g., `s3://my-bucket/wave/locks` or a local path).
