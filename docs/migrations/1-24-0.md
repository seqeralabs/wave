## Mandatory steps

Wave 1.24.0 adds support for SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation using Syft.

To use SBOM generation, add the following property to your Wave configuration:

- `wave.scan.reports.path`: Sets the path inside the S3 bucket where Wave will store SBOM reports. For example, `s3://wave-store/scan-reports`.
