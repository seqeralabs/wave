Wave 1.25.0 was released on September 2, 2025.

## Mandatory steps

Wave 1.25.0 upgrades Micronaut to 4.9.2 and Netty to 4.2.0. This changes the default Netty ByteBuf allocator from `PooledByteBufAllocator` to `AdaptiveRecvByteBufAllocator`, which may impact your memory usage patterns.

The Netty ByteBuf allocator must be explicitly set back to `PooledByteBufAllocator` to maintain stable memory usage patterns.

If you are passing custom `WAVE_JVM_OPTS`, add the following option to your Wave configuration:

```
-Dio.netty.allocator.type=pooled
```

See [Micronaut 4.9.2 Netty Memory Issue Analysis](https://github.com/seqeralabs/wave/blob/master/adr/mv-4.9-netty-memory.md) for more information.
