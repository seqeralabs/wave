title: Nextflow and Wave
description: Provision containers with Wave directly from your Nextflow pipelines
---

You can provision containers with Wave directly from your Nextflow pipelines.

**Prerequisites**

- You have an account with a container registry, such as DockerHub, and an access token that provides write access to your container repository.
- You have a [Seqera Cloud](https://cloud.seqera.io/login) or Platform account, to store your container registry credentials for Wave to use.
- You have either [Docker Desktop] or [Podman] installed locally.
- You have [Nextflow] 23.10.x or newer installed locally.

In this guide, you'll build a container from a Nextflow module and freeze that package in your private container repository.

## Create your Seqera access token

1. Log in to Seqera.
1. From your personal workspace: Go to the user menu and select **Settings > Your tokens**.
1. Select **Add token**.
1. Enter a unique name for your token, then select **Add**.
1. Copy and store your token securely.

    :::caution
    The access token is displayed only once. Save the token value before you close the **Personal Access Token** window.
    :::

1. In a terminal window, assign your access token to the `TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable:

    ```
    export TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token_token>
    ```

## Add your container registry credentials to Seqera

When freezing a container to the build repository that you specify, Wave uses Seqera to obtain your registry access credentials. If you use Docker as your container registry, complete the following steps:

To create your access token in Docker Hub:

1. Log in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
2. Select your username in the top right corner and select **Account Settings**.
3. Select **Security > New Access Token**.
4. Enter a token description. Select **Access permissions > Read-only**, then select **Generate**.
5. Copy and save the generated access token (this is only displayed once).

To add your credentials to Seqera:

1.  Add your credentials to your organization or personal workspace:
    - From an organization workspace: Go to **Credentials > Add Credentials**.
    - From your personal workspace: From the user menu, go to **Your credentials > Add credentials**.

2.  Complete the following fields:

    - **Name**: Specify a unique name for the credentials using alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores. For example, `my-registry-creds`.
    - **Provider**: Select **Container registry**.
    - **User name**: Specify your Docker username. For example, `user1`.
    - **Password**: Specify your personal access token (PAT). For example, `1fcd02dc-...215bc3f3`.
    - **Registry server**: Specify the container registry hostname, excluding the protocol. For example, `docker.io`.

3.  Select **Add**. The new credential will be listed under the **Credentials** tab.

Seqera supports other container registries, such as GitHub and Quay.io.

## Create a Nextflow pipeline that uses Wave

Nextflow can use Wave to seamlessly build a container directly from a Dockerfile in your pipeline.

1. In a terminal window, create a new directory for the Nextflow pipeline.

1. Create a `nextflow.config` file with the following contents:

    ```groovy
    docker {
      enabled = true
    }

    wave {
      build.repository = '<repo_uri>'
      wave.freeze = true
    }

    tower {
      accessToken = "$TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    }
    ```

    The `<repo_uri>` must be substituted with your private container repository.

1. Create a `wave.nf` file with the following contents:

    ```nextflow
    include { HELLO } from './modules/gamma'

    workflow {
      HELLO()
    }
    ```

1. Create a directory for the module:
    ```
    mkdir -p modules/gamma
    ```

1. Create the `modules/gamma/main.nf` file for the module:

    ```
    process HELLO {
      debug true

      """
      cowsay Hello!
      """
    }
    ```

1. Create the `modules/gamma/Dockerfile` file for the module:

    ```
    FROM alpine

    RUN apk update && apk add bash cowsay \
      --update-cache \
      --repository https://alpine.global.ssl.fastly.net/alpine/edge/community \
      --repository https://alpine.global.ssl.fastly.net/alpine/edge/main \
      --repository https://dl-3.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing

    RUN echo hello
    ```

## Run the Nextflow pipeline

To run the pipeline, and initiate the Wave container build, enter the following command:

```
nextflow run wave.nf -with-wave
```

The output from a successful execution is displayed in the following example:

```
Launching `wave.nf` [naughty_wiles] DSL2 - revision: 3756d705d9

executor >  local (1)
[c1/6d7d9d] HELLO | 1 of 1 âœ”
