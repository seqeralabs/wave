#   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#   Disable logs of `RecoveryInterceptor`, as they have been found to be noisy.
#   Declarative `io.micronaut.http.client.annotation.@Client`s are annotated with `io.micronaut.retry.annotation@Recoverable`
#   and throw an exception on every error response by default. `RecoveryInterceptor` ends up logging those exceptions
#   even if they are handled and no actual recovery/fallback logic gets to take place.
#   TODO remove once the project is updated to Micronaut 4.x, as @Client won't be annotated with @Recoverable anymore
#   See https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues/3719; https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/pull/8235
