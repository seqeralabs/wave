# Configuration for Wave deployments behind AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
#
# Enable this profile by setting MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=alb
#
# Security Note: Only enable this profile when Wave is deployed behind a trusted
# AWS Application Load Balancer. ALB automatically adds X-Forwarded-For with the
# real client IP address. Do NOT enable this profile for direct internet exposure
# as it would allow IP spoofing attacks.
